Repository of a small tech demo project that was planned to become part of my enry into analytical business process analysis, before RL came along.

Page cannot be accessed anymore. It went down with the Heroku Free-Tier.

Applied technologies include Hadoop and Webtechnologies.
============
- Process visualization using d3.js
- Selfwritten Regexp Webeditor that searched traces containing results on Hadoop
 You can find Hadoop parts in the [Piglet Git Repo](https://github.com/aahammer/piglet)
